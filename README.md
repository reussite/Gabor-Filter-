# gray-level-image-inversion
java code that uses the
ImageJ library, in order to open an image and convert it to gray, thus obtaining a
grayscale image.
```sh
IDE used: Netbeans
image processing software integrated into netbeans: ImageJ
```
***
## _some comments on the code_
- The Opener class allows you to find and select a file;
- The ImagePlus class represents the image;
-The new ImageConverter (imp) .convertToGray8 () instruction converts the image
contained in the ImagePlus object as an 8-bit grayscale image;
- The ImageProcessor class allows you to perform pixel operations.
