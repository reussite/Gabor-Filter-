## _some comments on the code_
- The Opener class allows you to find and select a file;
- The ImagePlus class represents the image;
-The new ImageConverter (imp) .convertToGray8 () instruction converts the image
contained in the ImagePlus object as an 8-bit grayscale image;
- The ImageProcessor class allows you to perform pixel operations.
